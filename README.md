# Aligner_Website
The website is built using the Django work environment. Its purpose is to help biologists. It is divided into two main services. The first is the alignment process for two sequences, and the second is the alignment process for more than one sequence. Each of them contains many algorithms, in addition to a detailed explanation of each type.
